# Guild-Bump
Guild Bump is a **public server list** bot,
created to help other servers grow more members.
We give you 3 steps how to setup and invite **Guild Bump**.

(Here's the [invite link!](https://invite.guildbump.eu/))
### **2. Scroll down and press** `Authorize`
### **3. Do The ReCaptcha Test**
Ironically the hardest part of inviting a bot to your server.
# Commands
Note: There's much more... useless commands you may know by typing `gb!help`!
If you want to change the prefix use `gb!prefix` and type with a new prefix the commands.
